    <p class="lead">We have a lean approach to teaching. Biologists don't do rocket science and rocket scientists don't do biology.<br>
    We provide teaching and support tailored to the user's need. We have an open door policy and guest terminals available to any user that wishes to run his/her computational work with us.
